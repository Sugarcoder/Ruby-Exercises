# Modules only hold behaviors, whereas classes hold behaviors & states. 

# Modules cannot be instantiated. Modules are like the superclass of Class (all classes are modules).



# Example:

module Candy
  def sweet_sugar
    "I like to eat sugar."
  end
end


class Lollipop
  include Candy
  
    
  def stick_candy 
    "Lollipops are fun to lick."
  end
end





puts Lollipop.new.sweet_sugar             


# Even though class Lollipop has its own behavior (stick_candy), it still needs the behavior "sweet_sugar")
