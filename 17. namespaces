# namespaces = putting similar object names together in a bundle 

# It's like having files with same names in different directories (within a folder).


:: = a constant lookup operator that 'looks up' the specific constant only



# Example:


module Apple
  A = 5
  module Banana
    B = 9
    A = 7
    
    class ScopeIn
      def push
        10
      end
    end
  end
end

A = 10

puts "Apple::Banana::ScopeIn.new.push"
