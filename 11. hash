# hash = { } 


# Example: 

fruits = {
          "apples" => 5,
          "bananas" => 5,
          "cherries" => 8
          }
          
          
          
          
# Fetching something from a hash

# Example: Finding the price of Ramen ($3):

restaurant_menu["Ramen"]                  # Put "Ramen" in [   ] to find the price of it





# Modifying a hash

# Example:

restaurant_menu = {}
restaurant_menu["Ramen"] = 5
restaurant+menu["Green Tea"] = 3
