# "lambda" is just a function (it can also be an object)

# Example (short string): 

1.lambda {"I love to eat cheese."}

puts 1.call


Increment = lambda { |number| number + 1}            # Adds a number everytime it is passed. 




# Notes:

# { } = used for short strings

# do...end = used for long strings




# Example (long string): 

1 = lambda do |string| 

if string == "try"
  return "Try?! You must do!" 
else 
  return "There's no such thing as trying. Only doing."
end
end

puts 1.call("try")
