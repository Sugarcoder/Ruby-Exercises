[1,2,3,4,5] << 6          # Adds "6" into the array


[1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5,6].push         # Adds "6" into the array






# map = transforms the contents of an array

# Example: 

[1,2,3,4,5].map { |i| i + 5}         # Answer is [6,7,8,9,10]






# select = select something from an array

# Example:

fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries", "grapes"]
fruits.select { |word| word.length > 5}





# delete = delete something from an array

# Example: 

[1,2,3,4,5].delete 5

[1,2,3,4,5,6].delete_if { |i| i % 2 ==0}            # This deletes all the even numbers (2,4,6), so the answer is [1,3,5]
